# Client-Server-Guessing-Game
Client server guessing game made in CS 342 in Spring 2020. Running the server code opens a port that allows for multithreading so multiple clients can connect and play the game. The clients will have to guess words in selected categories. Rules on how to play are explained in the client side UI. Created as a group.
